Integrated with Salesforce, GMS enables efficient service delivery, customer engagement, and operational management. This repository contains all the necessary resources and code to set up and optimize the GMS for Salesforce.

## Features

- **Customer Management**: Manage customer data, repair history, and service requests with Salesforce CRM.
- **Service Scheduling**: Integrate with Salesforce’s calendar for service scheduling and automated reminders.
- **Repair Tracking**: Track the repair process, including job status, parts ordering, and technician assignment.
- **Invoicing and Payments**: Generate invoices, integrate with payment gateways, and manage financial transactions.
- **Inventory Management**: Real-time tracking of parts and tools inventory with Salesforce integration for procurement management.
- **Technician Management**: Assign technicians based on availability and skillset, and track performance.
- **Customer Communication**: Automate appointment confirmations, reminders, service updates, and manage customer feedback.
- **Reporting and Analytics**: Generate custom reports and dashboards to track key performance indicators (KPIs).

## Salesforce Integration Overview

The Garage Management System leverages several key features of Salesforce:

- **Custom Objects**: Used for managing repairs, service requests, inventory, and invoices.
- **Flows**: Automate service scheduling, reminders, customer follow-ups, and notifications.
- **Apex**: Implement custom logic for invoicing, payment management, and service tracking.
- **Lightning Components**: Build responsive UIs for managing repairs, service requests, and technician schedules.
- **Third-party API Integrations**: Integrate external systems like payment gateways, parts suppliers, and SMS/email services.

## Development Steps

### 1. Setup Salesforce Org
- Ensure access to a Salesforce Developer Org.
- Install necessary packages and enable API access for third-party integrations.

### 2. Creating Custom Objects
- **Repair Job**: (Fields: Job Name, Customer, Technician, Status, Service Date)
- **Invoice**: (Fields: Amount, Customer, Status, Date of Issue)
- Define relationships between objects (e.g., link Repair Jobs to Customers and Technicians).

### 3. Develop Apex Classes and Triggers
- Write **Apex Classes** for complex business logic (e.g., calculating repair costs).
- Create **Apex Triggers** to automate actions such as status updates or email notifications.

### 4. Implement Flows
- Use **Flow Builder** to automate processes like customer follow-ups, service reminders, and feedback management.
- Set up **Scheduled Flows** for appointment and payment reminders.

### 5. Create Lightning Web Components (LWC)
- Develop **LWCs** for a modern, responsive UI. Example: Display technician’s current workload and service requests.

### 6. API Integrations
- **Payment Gateway Integration**: Use Salesforce APIs to integrate with external payment systems.
- **Parts Ordering**: Integrate with parts suppliers to manage inventory and order new parts when stock is low.

### 7. Reports & Dashboards
- Create **Custom Reports** to track metrics like service completion times, revenue, and technician performance.
- Develop **Dashboards** to provide real-time insights to managers and business owners.

### 8. Testing & Deployment
- Test the system thoroughly to ensure all integrations and automations work as expected.
- Deploy using **Change Sets** or **Salesforce DX** from a sandbox to the production environment.

## Best Practices

- **Code Optimization**: Ensure Apex code is optimized for performance by avoiding large data operations in loops and using efficient queries.
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write test classes for all Apex code to ensure reliability and meet Salesforce’s deployment requirements.
- **Security Considerations**: Use **Field-Level Security** and **Object-Level Security** to protect sensitive data.
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation for custom code, objects, and automation processes.

## Conclusion
The Garage Management System (GMS) for Salesforce is designed to help automotive repair facilities manage operations more efficiently, improve customer service, and streamline business processes. By leveraging Salesforce’s powerful tools, developers can create a fully integrated solution that supports customer management, inventory tracking, invoicing, and much more.
